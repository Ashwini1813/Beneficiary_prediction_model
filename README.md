# 🧓 Beneficiary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person is a valid beneficiary for a pension using a machine learning model. It is part of the Edunet Foundation's IBM Cloud internship, where IBM Cloud Pak for Data was used to develop and deploy the solution.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

To create a predictive model that identifies pension beneficiaries based on historical data and personal attributes.

## 💡 Solution Overview

- Preprocessed pension data (`pension_data.csv`)
- Built a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier)
- Evaluated the model for accuracy
- Deployed the model on IBM Cloud (Watsonx for Data)

## 🧠 Libraries Used

- Python (3.x)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
